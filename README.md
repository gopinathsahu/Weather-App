Weather App README

Overview
Welcome to the Weather App built with React.js! This application allows users to check real-time weather information for any city of their choice. It fetches data from the OpenWeather API and displays details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. Users can easily switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit for temperature readings.

Features
Real-Time Weather Data: Fetches and displays current weather conditions for any city.
Temperature Conversion: Easily convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
Clear User Interface: Designed to be user-friendly with a responsive layout.

Technologies and Dependencies
React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
React Icons: A collection of customizable icons.
React-Bootstrap: Bootstrap components for React, allowing for quick and responsive styling.
Additionally, we will implement React hooks, specifically useState and useEffect, to manage state and side effects within our component.
